# Catering Coordinator App

##Walkthrough of Our Site

This app was created for individuals that would like to keep track of events that they have catered or are planning to cater.

When you first arrive to the website you will be on the homepage. You will only be able to register for access to our site or log in if you are a returning user.

Once you are logged in you will be able to view, create, update or delete items in 3 different tables(Food, Customer, Event).

While logged in you are only able to view the data that you have entered.
